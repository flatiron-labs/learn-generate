TODO

* basically mkdir with folders/files for each of the templates depending on the argument of the call. it accounts for gitignore and gemfile (no bundle command; the lab writer will do that after they determine their additional dependencies)

* will make the lab-template in the PWD of where the gem call is made

* checks that the template names are valid and that name in the right format; if not through error.
