TODO

1. basically mkdir with folders/files for each of the templates depending on the argument of the call. it accounts for gitignore and gemfile (no bundle command; the lab writer will do that after they determine their additional dependencies)

2. will need to incorporate bash scripts to do all of the generation?

3. You can specify the name of the lab so it creates the top level by that name.

4. will make the lab-template in the PWD of where the gem call is made
